ðŸ§¸ðŸ’¬ In some scenarios location of users and devices are from different area and this is one of ```the tracking variable``` by design for ```detecting fakes evidence scenarios``` or fraud detection as in some descriptions. It is not data science to filter and ```generate criminal data``` as new generation understands, people who working this has background and ```police relationship``` different than other fields. </br>
ðŸ¥ºðŸ’¬ I have some background but am not professional in frads detection, I apply for backend integrations as this is the correct understanding. ```Risks management``` and ```Frad detection``` are from these kinds of skills that do not make mistakes and I explain to recruiters when they call for screen interviews correctly. </br>
ðŸ¦¤ðŸ’¬ Every job has its required skills proficiency but working with complex scenarios with the ability to respond is one chapter of correct training skills. As seen people are like of famous positions such as risks and ```frauds detection``` or ```security engineer``` or ```IT security team``` they are working in encaps environment with ```teams relationship``` to response to ```detecting to incident action``` not a ```hacker```. âš½ðŸ‘¤ðŸ’¬ ATM team krub ( This is values of working experience with relationship ) </br>
