# Fakes evidence scenarios
🧸💬 In some scenarios location of users and devices are from different area and this is one of ```the tracking variable``` by design for ```detecting fakes evidence scenarios``` or fraud detection as in some descriptions. It is not data science to filter and ```generate criminal data``` as new generation understands, people who working this has background and ```police relationships``` different than other fields. </br>
🥺💬 I have some background but am not professional in ```frads detection```, I apply for ```backend integrations``` as this is the correct understanding. ```Risks management``` and ```Frad detection``` are from these kinds of skills that do not make mistakes and I explain them to recruiters when they call for screen interviews correctly. 🏡🔊👤🗯️🗯️🗯️🏡🥺💬 .... because your understanding is not correct. </br>
🦤💬 Every job has its required skills ```proficiency``` but working with ```complex scenarios``` with the ```ability to respond``` is one chapter of correct training skills. As seen people are like of famous positions such as risks and ```frauds detection``` or ```security engineer``` or ```IT security team``` they are working in encaps environment with ```teams relationship``` to response to ```detecting to incident action``` not a ```hacker```. ⚽👤💬 ATM team krub ( This is values of working experience with relationship ) </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 There are many fields that ```applied of data sciences``` skills and ```telecommunication skills``` such as ```IT networks communications```, ```IT networks analysis```, ```Business analysis```, ```software and hardware R&D``` and ```automatic feedbacks response system``` . That is because there is a short-term and long-term of actions, ```action response in role``` is short and long term action but development and scenarios and work in short and long team actions </br>
🥺💬 Working time all are working as the same team as see the example of how ```theifs fakes``` the ATM verification method, the same as PASTA scenarios they fake evidence of ```location services``` . </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Theifs are not fools otherwise we build systems that automatically protect people from them but they are ```smart with the wrong intention and purpose```. </br>
