# Fakes evidence scenarios
🧸💬 In some scenarios location of users and devices are from different area and this is one of ```the tracking variable``` by design for ```detecting fakes evidence scenarios``` or fraud detection as in some descriptions. It is not data science to filter and ```generate criminal data``` as new generation understands, people who working this has background and ```police relationships``` different than other fields. </br>
🥺💬 I have some background but am not professional in ```frads detection```, I apply for ```backend integrations``` as this is the correct understanding. ```Risks management``` and ```Frad detection``` are from these kinds of skills that do not make mistakes and I explain them to recruiters when they call for screen interviews correctly. 🏡🔊👤🗯️🗯️🗯️🏡🥺💬 .... because your understanding is not correct. </br>
🦤💬 Every job has its required skills ```proficiency``` but working with ```complex scenarios``` with the ```ability to respond``` is one chapter of correct training skills. As seen people are like of famous positions such as risks and ```frauds detection``` or ```security engineer``` or ```IT security team``` they are working in encaps environment with ```teams relationship``` to response to ```detecting to incident action``` not a ```hacker```. ⚽👤💬 ATM team krub ( This is values of working experience with relationship ) </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 There are many fields that ```applied of data sciences``` skills and ```telecommunication skills``` such as ```IT networks communications```, ```IT networks analysis```, ```Business analysis```, ```software and hardware R&D``` and ```automatic feedbacks response system``` . That is because there is a short-term and long-term of actions, ```action response in role``` is short and long term action but development and scenarios and work in short and long team actions </br>
🥺💬 Working time all are working as the same team as see the example of how ```theifs fakes``` the ATM verification method, the same as PASTA scenarios they fake evidence of ```location services``` . </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 Theifs are not fools otherwise we build systems that automatically protect people from them but they are ```smart with the wrong intention and purpose```. </br>

## 🧸💬 Confirmation messages as Vending machine or public exchange machine

🦭💬 Location evidence, priority of evidence considered from intention to create when location is including ```vehicle```, ```transportation```, ```make mistakes in communication``` and ```fakes identification``` . That is because of machine working to ``` served the identity``` they receive input from the authorization process this is after business negotiation the machine cannot ```verify``` or ```negotiable``` they received and believe in the ```authentication method results```. </br>
🧸💬 After ```authentication and verification``` methods the machine works as an ```authorized person``` and continues its function by the ability of its running platforms, ```identification``` is a high priority and ```authentication``` is critical in ATM machine learning, your ``ID has value``. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ Somebody has been stolen my money from me with this scenario and 🥺💬 I had the same scenario, it is simpler and the bank manager tracked the theifs by bank's security cameras. This is initiate story I am working in the Financial banking business  ```🥺💬 Thank you manager 👤 🐾🐾🐱💬 I am extra ordinary, my skills is known about the process exceptions not strong hammers but we fight criminals.``` </br> 
👧💬 🎈 Everybody can have story and ```skills comes from practice```, ```study and listen, understand``` and ```inheritances``` and ```transition``` by will as in laws, police how the potential came from ️⁉️ 👮‍♂️👮‍♀️💬💬 ```By Initially you had from family```, ```your study in school```, ```experience and relationship```, ```management to have``` and ```transition```. The transition is hard but applying this rule must be ```experts and can prove the potential with efficiency from the process and working as procedure```. </br>

🐐💬 In some cases, mistake action applies to the policy controls machine but it does not fully apply the role of the auto-machine perform or work responsibilities, a common role applied for the identity of the action response for the judgment and security insurance claims. Sometimes it is difficult to prove that the action to the mistakes is from a user whose own identity or someone in consideration perform by plan and scenario. </br>

💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 ```Auto-response machine``` working by program procedure created the ```logging with policy``` to improve the ```process and development``` and there are many cases found of common behaviors, and the apply of policy working this way. ```Higher potential in actions should have a slower response and transparent mapping policy for action```. You have to accept that police have high potential action but sometimes they had slow action against the ATM machine ```👮‍♀️💬 I just thought only at the month-end period only.``` </br>
👧💬 🎈 That is because ```high-potential actions``` need to be carefully applied to our ```citizens``` and some actions cannot be reversed they are working on the ```risks of police``` as ```criminal discriminators```. </br>
