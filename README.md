ğŸ§¸ğŸ’¬ In some scenarios location of users and devices are from different area and this is one of ```the tracking variable``` by design for ```detecting fakes evidence scenarios``` or fraud detection as in some descriptions. It is not data science to filter and ```generate criminal data``` as new generation understanding, people who working this has background and ```police relationship``` different than other fields. </br>
ğŸ¥ºğŸ’¬ I have some background but am not professional in frads detection, I apply for backend integrations as this is the correct understanding. ```Risks management``` and ```Frad detection``` are from these kinds of skills that do not make mistakes and I explain to recruiters when they call for screen interviews correctly. </br>
